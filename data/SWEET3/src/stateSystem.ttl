In hydrodynamics, it is usually further required that a steady state exist throughout the atmospheric or fluid model. The equilibrium may be stable or unstable with respect to displacements therefrom. See also hydrostatic equilibrium, geostrophic equilibrium, instability. 2. In thermodynamics, any state of a system that would not undergo change if the system were to be isolated.""" .
